Download the zip file, and go to the directory.
Execute the version for your OS architecture, for example:

sudo ./VentoyGUI.x86_64

This will open the GUI.

Remember to test your Pendrive to make sure it is able to boot from bootable images after the installation.

YUMI:

Use YUMI for Windows, the "current" Debian version of the software works but does not create the bootable USB memory.
