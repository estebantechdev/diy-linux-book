How to install a new theme in KiCad
-----------------------------------

Unzip the Theme File

First, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the theme.

Navigate to your Downloads folder (or wherever the file is)
$ cd ~/Downloads

Unzip the file
$ unzip kikad-gruvbox-theme-main.zip

This will create a new directory, usually named "kikad-gruvbox-theme-main"

Copy the Theme Files
Now, navigate into the unzipped theme folder and copy the .json theme files into the KiCad colors directory you just verified.

Navigate into the unzipped folder
$ cd kikad-gruvbox-theme-main

Copy only the .json files to your KiCad colors directory
(Again, replace '8.0' with your version if needed)

$ cp *.json ~/.config/kicad/8.0/colors/

The installation is now complete. The theme files are in the correct location for KiCad to find them.

How to Activate the Theme in KiCad

You must select the theme inside KiCad's preferences:

Open KiCad.

Go to the main menu and select Preferences -> Preferences...

In the preferences window, navigate to the Colors section (under Schematic Editor or PCB Editor).

At the bottom of the window, you will see a "Color theme" dropdown menu.

Click the dropdown and select "Gruvbox Dark" or "Gruvbox Light" from the list.

Click OK to save your changes.

You may need to apply the theme to both the Schematic Editor and PCB Editor sections separately.

Restart KiCad for all changes to take full effect.
