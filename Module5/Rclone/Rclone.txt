Rclone is an open-source, command-line program used for managing files in cloud storage, allowing you to copy, sync, move, and encrypt files between cloud providers or between a local computer and the cloud. It supports over 70 cloud storage providers, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3, and can also mount a remote cloud folder as a local drive. Its features include robust error checking and the ability to resume interrupted transfers.

Installation:
To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:
$ sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

Create the "gdrive" remote:
$ rclone config

Log in using web browser when required.

When the normal config finishes, on Google Drive, create links from the share directory to clone in local to the root of the Google drive:
Make right click on the shared with you directory and give the link a name, for example: Arduino-Robotics.

Here is the command that works to save logs to file:
$ rclone copy gdrive:Arduino-Robotics ./ -v --log-file logs.txt
