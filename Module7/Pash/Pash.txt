Pash (by Dylan Araps) which is a simple shell-based password manager using GPG.

Here’s how to use it (installation, configuration, commands, tips) based on its documentation and source:

Installation & Setup
---------------------

Get the script

You can clone or download pash from its GitHub repository: dylanaraps/pash

Make it executable and install it

For example:

$ chmod +x pash
$ sudo mv pash /usr/local/bin/

Or place it somewhere in your PATH.

Ensure dependencies

You need gpg or gpg2 installed (for encryption/decryption).

For clipboard support, xclip is often used by default.

Configuration via Environment Variables
---------------------------------------

| Variable       | Purpose                                                             | Default / Notes                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

Basic Usage & Commands
----------------------

Once installed and configured, you use pash with subcommands like:

$ pash add web/gmail
$ pash list
$ pash show github
$ pash copy github
$ pash del example
$ pash tree

| Command / Alias     | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add [name]` / `a`  | Create a new password entry with the given name             |
| `list` / `l`        | List all entries (flat list)                                |
| `tree` / `t`        | Show entries in a tree structure                            |
| `show [name]` / `s` | Decrypt & display the password for `name`                   |
| `copy [name]` / `c` | Copy the password into the clipboard (clears after timeout) |
| `del [name]` / `d`  | Delete the password entry                                   |

When you call pash without arguments, it shows usage/help.

You can do:

$ pash show mysite/username

It will generate a password (according to PASH_LENGTH & PASH_PATTERN) and store the encrypted file in PASH_DIR.

To see it:

$ pash show mysite/username

To copy to clipboard:

$ pash copy mysite/username

The clipboard will be cleared after PASH_TIMEOUT seconds.

To delete:

$ pash del mysite/username

Compatibility & Migration
-------------------------

pash is compatible with the store format of pass (the more known “password-store” tool) in many cases.

You can set PASH_DIR and PASH_KEYID so that pash reads from the same store used by pass.

Some users report successful migration: by reading .gpg-id and pointing PASH_DIR to the pass store.

Caveats & Security Notes
------------------------

Because it’s a simple shell tool, it's relatively minimal; some features in more mature managers (like auto-typing, 2FA, secret sharing) may be missing.

Be careful with clipboard history managers — some may keep history of copied content even after pash clears the clipboard. pash gives a default clipboard timeout, but that doesn’t guarantee pasting isn’t stored elsewhere.

If you lose your GPG key (or passphrase), you lose access to stored passwords.

Always keep backups of encrypted store (but not your private key).

Since it's shell-based, avoid enabling set -x or debugging modes that might leak contents during operations

Setting up pash step by step on your system (Ubuntu, Arch, etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Install dependencies

You’ll need:

GPG – for encryption/decryption

xclip (or wl-clipboard if you use Wayland) – for clipboard support

On Debian/Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install gnupg xclip

On Arch/Manjaro:

$ sudo pacman -S gnupg xclip

Step 2: Download and install Pash

$ git clone https://github.com/dylanaraps/pash.git
$ cd pash
$ chmod +x pash
$ sudo mv pash /usr/local/bin/

You can confirm installation:

$ pash

You should see the help menu.

Step 3: Set up your GPG key

If you don’t already have a GPG key, create one:

$ gpg --full-generate-key

Choose:

Type: RSA and RSA

Key size: 4096

Validity: 0 (never expires)

Add your name and email

List your keys afterward:

$ gpg --list-keys

Example output:

pub   rsa4096 2025-10-09 [SC]
      1234ABCD5678EFGH1234567890ABCDEF12345678
uid           [ultimate] Esteban Herrera <you@example.com>

Copy that key ID (e.g., 1234ABCD5678EFGH1234567890ABCDEF12345678).

Step 4: Configure Pash

Create your config directory:

$ mkdir -p ~/.config/pash

Then, export or set your environment variables in your shell (or ~/.bashrc):

$ export PASH_KEYID="your-key-id"
$ export PASH_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/pash"
$ export PASH_CLIP="xclip -selection clipboard"
$ export PASH_TIMEOUT=15

Reload your shell:

$ source ~/.bashrc

Step 5: Use Pash

Add a password
$ pash add github

This creates an encrypted entry at:

~/.local/share/pash/github.gpg

Show the password
$ pash show github

Copy it to clipboard
$ pash copy github

It will auto-clear after 15 seconds.

List all stored entries
$ pash list

Delete an entry
$ pash del github

Optional: Generate your own passwords

If you want to create your own passwords before adding them:

$ openssl rand -base64 24

Or change PASH_LENGTH (default 50):

$ export PASH_LENGTH=20

Step 6: (Optional) Integrate with pass

If you already use pass, you can make pash use the same store:

$ export PASH_DIR="$HOME/.password-store"
$export PASH_KEYID="$(cat ~/.password-store/.gpg-id)"

Difference between pash add mysite/username and pash add github examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The difference between:

$ pash add mysite/username

and

$ pash add github

is mainly organizational, not functional — both create encrypted password files, but the first one places it in a subdirectory structure.

Password store

File path examples:

~/.local/share/pash/github.gpg
~/.local/share/pash/mysite/username.gpg

Example:

$ pash add github/personal
$ pash add github/work
$ pash add google/main
$ pash add google/backup

Then pash tree would show:

.
├── github
│   ├── personal.gpg
│   └── work.gpg
└── google
    ├── main.gpg
    └── backup.gpg

How to list and search nested entries in Pash
---------------------------------------------

1. List All Entries

The simplest way:

$ pash list

This prints a flat list of all password entries, including subdirectories.

2. Show Tree View (Hierarchical)

If you prefer a folder-style view:

$ pash tree

Ideal when you’ve grouped multiple passwords under the same category or service.

3. Search for Specific Entries

To find only entries matching part of a name, you can pipe the list to grep:

$ pash list | grep github

Example output:

github/personal
github/work

Or search across all nested folders for a keyword:

$ pash list | grep mysite

This helps when you have a large number of entries.

4. Filter or Count Entries (Optional)

Count how many entries you have:

$ pash list | wc -l

List only entries under one folder:

$ pash list | grep '^mysite/'

5. Bonus: Open or Copy from a Search Result

You can even combine it to directly copy a match:

$ pash copy "$(pash list | grep github/work)"

Or show it:

$ pash show "$(pash list | grep mysite/username)"

Backup the pash passwords to use them in another computer
---------------------------------------------------------

Backing up your Pash passwords (and restoring them on another machine) is very simple, because Pash uses only encrypted .gpg files — meaning you can safely copy them anywhere, as long as you also keep your GPG private key.

1. Understand What You Need to Back Up

To fully restore Pash on another computer, you need two things:

| What                     | Description                         | Default Location                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🗂 **Password store**    | All encrypted `.gpg` password files | `~/.local/share/pash/` (or your `$PASH_DIR`) |
| 🔑 **Your GPG key pair** | Used to decrypt passwords           | Stored in `~/.gnupg/`                        |

Without your GPG key, the encrypted files are unreadable.

2. Back Up on Your Current Computer

You can use tar to back up both at once:

$ tar -czvf ~/pash-backup.tar.gz ~/.local/share/pash ~/.gnupg

Or, if you prefer, just back up the store:

$ tar -czvf ~/pash-store.tar.gz ~/.local/share/pash

Store this .tar.gz on a secure USB drive, encrypted volume, or cloud storage (preferably encrypted, too).

3. Restore on Another Computer

Step 1: Install dependencies and Pash

On the new system:

$ sudo apt install gnupg xclip
$ git clone https://github.com/dylanaraps/pash.git
$ cd pash
$ sudo mv pash /usr/local/bin/

Step 2: Restore backup

Copy your .tar.gz to the new system and unpack it:

$ tar -xzvf pash-backup.tar.gz -C ~/

This restores:

~/.local/share/pash/ (passwords)

~/.gnupg/ (keys)

Step 3: Fix permissions

$ chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
$ chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/*
$ chmod -R 700 ~/.local/share/pash

4. Verify GPG Key Import

If you backed up .gnupg, you’re done.

Otherwise, if you only copied the password files, you can manually export/import your GPG key:

On your original computer:
$ gpg --export-secret-keys --armor "Your Name or KeyID" > ~/privatekey.asc

On your new computer:
$ gpg --import ~/privatekey.asc

5. Test the Restore

Run:
$ pash list

Then:
$ pash show github

6. Security Recommendations

Keep two copies of your backup (one offline, one offsite).

Never store the .gnupg directory unencrypted in the cloud.

If you use multiple computers, consider syncing only the password store (not the private key) via Git or rsync — but import the key manually on each trusted device.

If you can decrypt successfully — your backup is valid.
